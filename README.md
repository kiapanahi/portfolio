 | My focus is on designing and developing horizontally scalable services with high throughput and low maintenance cost. These services are used as a ground for business developers to easily develop their business needs without having to think about their basic needs such as authentication and authorization, subscription engines, large scale credit/score calculations, high throughput messaging solutions, fairness, concurrency issues and lots of other headaches businesses usually avoid addressing the right way.
 We contribute to Open Source Community by developing and open sourcing a large number of our services (see Clay-One on [GitHub](https://github.com/clay-one) and [Medium](https://medium.com/clay-one) and Appson on [GitHub](https://github.com/appson)) as well as contributing to famous projects such as [MetricBeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat).Some of the projects and platforms that I&#39;ve been working on are as follows: **Ghasedak:** A highly scalable, efficient, messaging platform capable of delivering up to 5000 messages per second. The solution is based on micro-service architecture and relies heavily on asynchronous messaging and event-sourcing. Technologies used in the platform include Redis, Apache Kafka, DotNet Core, and MongoDB. **Piqo:** A full-featured payment solution capable of handling multiple user subscriptions and subscription plans and can charge them through many payment gateways including but not limited to DCB, DirectDebit, IPG/MPG. Piqo is architected as a multi-instance service and is utilizing MSSQL Server w/ Entity Framework, MongoDB, ASP.NET WebApi, Caching, etc. **Tesseract:** A subscription engine designed to handle a massive amount of meta-data (tags) surrounding an identity with lightning-fast search capability and full-featured searching DSL. On a single node, it can store and query more than 40,000,000 identities and their tags within milliseconds. It&#39;s built on top of Mongo, Redis and Elasticsearch as its data stores and is using sophisticated background job scheduling/processing system which we built ourselves, called Nebula. **Nebula:** A scalable reliable background job scheduler/processor capable of delivering and accepting jobs via multiple channels including but not limited to HTTP endpoints, Apache Kafka topics, Redis queues. It also provides job execution status and control over pausing, canceling, flushing and stopping a job. Using another in-house build identity provider service, it also supports simple to complex ACL scenarios. **Sejel** : An identity solution capable of providing any system with world-standard authentication mechanisms. It leverages JWT standard for authentication token handling and can be easily used alongside OAuth solutions. Sejel is heavily load tested and is designed so that it could be horizontally scaled on the fly to serve tens of thousands of requests per second. it also provides the application developer/end-user with multiple authentication factors including but not limited to two-factor SMS authentication, Email/Password authentication, Google account authentication, etc. |
